        <h1>Privacy Policy for Claude Helper</h1>
        <p><em>Last updated: [21 - Oct - 2024]</em></p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Claude Helper is a browser extension designed to enhance the functionality of Claude AI by allowing bulk folder uploads, quick project resets, and additional features to improve user experience. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you feel confident while using our extension.</p>

        <h2>Data Handling and Transmission</h2>
        <p>Claude Helper is designed with privacy in mind. We want to be clear about our data practices:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Limited Data Transmission</strong>: Claude Helper does not collect or store any user data on external servers. When you use the bulk upload feature, the extension transmits the contents of your selected files to Claude AI. This transmission is necessary for the core functionality of the extension.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Operation</strong>: Most functions of the extension operate entirely within your browser and the Claude AI environment. No data is sent to any servers other than Claude AI's.</li>
            <li><strong>File Handling</strong>: When you use the bulk upload feature, the extension temporarily reads the contents of your selected files in your browser's memory. This data is then transmitted directly to your Claude AI project. The extension does not retain this data after the upload is complete.</li>
            <li><strong>No External Servers</strong>: Your data is only transmitted to Claude AI's servers. The extension does not send data to any third-party servers or services.</li>
            <li><strong>No Authentication Data</strong>: The extension works with your existing Claude AI login and does not require or store any additional authentication information.</li>
            <li><strong>Respecting Claude AI's File Restrictions</strong>: The extension adheres to Claude AI's existing file upload restrictions. Unsupported file types will be skipped during folder uploads and not transmitted.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Storage</strong>: The extension uses local browser storage to save user preferences and settings. This data is stored entirely on your device and is not transmitted to any external servers.</li>
            <li><strong>File Exclusion and Version Control</strong>: Our file exclusion and version control features use file hashing to determine which files to upload. This process occurs locally in your browser and does not involve transmitting additional data beyond the files you choose to upload.</li>
            <li><strong>Settings Export</strong>: The extension allows you to export your settings as a JSON file. This file is saved locally on your device and is not transmitted to any servers. Please be aware that this file may contain your personal preferences and should be handled with care.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Permissions</h2>
        <p>Claude Helper requires the following browser permissions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Access to https://claude.ai/*: This is necessary for the extension to function on the Claude AI website.</li>
            <li>Storage: This permission allows the extension to save your settings locally in your browser.</li>
            <li>Downloads: This permission is used when you choose to export your settings as a JSON file.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These permissions are used solely for the stated purposes and do not involve transmitting data to external servers.</p>

        <h2>Features and Privacy</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Minimap</strong>: The minimap feature for chat pages provides an overview of long conversations. It operates entirely within your browser and does not involve any data transmission or storage beyond what's already present on the Claude AI page.</li>
            <li><strong>Two-click access</strong>: The feature to start a new Claude conversation from any website does not involve any data collection or transmission. It simply provides a shortcut to Claude AI.</li>
            <li><strong>Options Window</strong>: The new options window and its settings are stored locally in your browser and are not transmitted to any external servers.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Claude Helper does not integrate with or use any third-party services or analytics tools.</p>

        <h2>Changes to the Project or Claude AI Platform</h2>
        <p>As Claude Helper is designed to work with the Claude AI platform, changes to Claude AI may affect the functionality of our extension. We will strive to update Claude Helper as necessary to maintain compatibility and security.</p>

        <h2>Updates to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy.</p>
